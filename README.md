Developed as a front desk Java application, Rental Wheels manages the daily transactions of a car rental service. The application connects to the database of the car rental system to handle the booking, billing and reception of cars. The customers are registered into the system. Cars can then be booked for them, using a set of convenient drop downs that modify themselves based on selection of the previous drop down (for e.g. on selecting the type of car, the next drop downs will only display the brands and models that are of that type). 
Every booking is given a unique id which is used when the customer returns the car. Details of all the cars can also be viewed.
This project was developed as a part of the curriculum to demonstrate a Java front-end and database connectivity.

Test the application
1. Use a MySQL server (I used XAMPP for this) database and create a database 'car_rental'.
2. Import car_rental.sql into the database.
3. Run Rental_Wheels.jar located in ../rwheels/Rental_Wheels/dist.
4. Use the 'guest' as id and 'aaaaa' as password (I know its silly).

Thanks to the developer of the 'animation class' library. You'll find the readme file for it in the Animation Class (Version 1,5) directory.
